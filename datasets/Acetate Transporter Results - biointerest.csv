Even though no significant growth differences were detectable, obvious phenotypes of glycogen-deficient mutants (ΔglgA1/ΔglgA2, ΔglgC) were observed under strict photoautotrophic conditions: (i) elevated sensitivity to high light intensities (not shown) and to low inocula (Fig. 1a) and (ii) significant reduction in photosynthetic capacity.
